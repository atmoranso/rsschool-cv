### A few words about me:
My whole life I work in IT industry, but time to time in different directions. Current job is a full service of one small dental network websites (more SEO and SMM than programming). My next (but not the last) goal is to improve my basic front-end developer skills and get deeper knowledges in JavaScript. Also in the future I'd like to learn React Native and Electron Platform that based on JavaScript. In the future. If we survive.
